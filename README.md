# watch-rust (watchr)

A (silly) command-line tool similar to Linux's `watch`, written in Rust!

## Motivation

I wanted to get an introduction to Rust, so I decided to write a simple tool that I use often: [`watch`](https://www.unix.com/man-page/Linux/1/watch/).

I've always been frustrated there's no real equivalent for `watch` on Windows, (that I could find), so this project closes that gap and allows me to learn Rust at the same time.
